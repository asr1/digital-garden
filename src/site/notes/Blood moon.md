I'm a [[superstitious\|superstitious]] guy, more or less. It's paid off. In college, I would avoid going out on Friday the 13th, and would inevitably be lured out of my dorm by conspiring colleagues. 

Inevitably, these led to various misadventures or bad luck following, and I gained a reputation. Once, I went out during a blood moon and was dumped by my girlfriend of over a year the next day. These things happened!
