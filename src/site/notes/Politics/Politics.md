### Politics

* Everything is political.
* Some things are more explicitly political than others
	* Things directly related to governing: elections, laws, politicians
	* Restrictions and regulations that affect a class of people
* Saying "I don't discuss politics" is not *meaningless* just because "everything is political"
* What you consider to be *apolitical* reflects your own beliefs. Those are the topics that are in the water around you; you cannot see them.
	* "There are two races, white and political."
