You can use whatever pronouns you'd like for yourself, and I will do my best to respect them.

I think it's a bit silly (and more than a bit cumbersome!) to say that you don't use any pronouns, but will do my best to follow your wishes, at least for personal pronouns. For second-person and group pronouns (everybody, the world, you all), I make no such effort.

I find it a little hard to take people seriously when they use neo-pronouns, but I try not to let that show, or to treat them differently as a result. 

I have absolutely no problem with they/them. I am sometimes confused when people say any pronoun is fine, or list she and him as preferences. 

I recognize that this is an opportunity for personal and interpersonal improvement.
