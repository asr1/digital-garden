# Methodism

There are three pillars of Methodism:

* Rationality (what makes sense)
* Tradition (how has this historically been done)
* Scripture (what does the bible say)

All three should be considered equally, like three legs of a stool.

I like this, because it recognizes that some things don't make sense. Methodists don't have to believe that the [Pope is literally incapable of being wrong](https://research.reading.ac.uk/research-blog/pope-never-wrong-history-papal-infallibility-catholic-church/) (Ex cathedra), nor must they believe that the communion wafer stops being bread and literally becomes Christ's body. 

Methodists are comfortable with metaphor, with fallibility, and with logic.

That doesn't mean they [always get it right](https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-united-methodist-church). United Methodist Church has a strict anti-gay stance that I believe is incompatible with the modern world and with the Christian tenet of loving our neighbor.

## Founding Principles

Methodism was founded by John Wesley on 3 principles
* Do no harm, and avoid all evils
* Do good, as far as possible to all, and as far as possible
* Practice the ordinances of God, engaging in practices (both individual and communal) of prayer, bible reading, worship, and communion.

# John Wesley
> In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity
> â€“ Probably not John Wesley

The point is clear: as a religion, agree about the essential things, let people choose for themselves on everything else, but above all else, don't be a dick about it.
