Tone policing is often brought up as a no-no. "Don't tell me how to express myself, how I'm *allowed* to express myself."

I disagree with that.

I don't think tone policing is saying "you're not allowed to talk this way", but rather "if you want to be heard by this audience, it's self-defeating not to do it in this way."

That's not to say that it's *correct* or *proper*, just that context matters. I've heard the argument that "I shouldn't have to acquiesce to something like that, to let them dictate the rules of how I have to engage with them."

Morally, that's fine. But if you want to make a connection, you have to come across like someone willing to hear and be heard. It's all signaling.

## Profanity

There's a large portion of the country (US) that won't take you seriously if you make your point with profanity. You can argue that it *shouldn't* be that way, but let me ask you this: if you know, for a fact, that people will stop listening to you if you say the word "fuck", why would you say it in that context?

It might be a dumb rule, but it's one you have to abide by *if* you want any chance of being heard by these people.

## John Oliver

I don't watch John Oliver. It's mastubatory, or sybaritic if you'd rather be polite about it.

It goes beyond preaching to the choir (though it does that too).

One particular example (skip to 18:48):

To talk about Climate Change, John Oliver brought in Bill Nye. Bill Nye is (at least somewhat) respected by people on all political sides. John could have produced an informative, neutral segment from an admired and admitted expert.

Instead, he punched down and said "the planet's on fucking fire". There was an opportunity to extend an olive branch or learning, and instead ensured not only that no evangelicals would hear the message, but to signal "it's not for you."
