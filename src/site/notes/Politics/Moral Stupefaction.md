AKA Moral Dumbfounding AKA Moral Blindspots

[Source](https://verdict.justia.com/2012/09/05/the-significance-of-blind-spots-in-moral-reasoning)
Jonathan Haidt's A Righteous Mind


Statements that confound liberals: Are the following statements immoral?

Right wing say YES.
Left wing struggle because there isn't a clear value being violated, but they don't *feel* right.  

* A family’s dog was killed by a car in front of their house.  They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog’s body and cooked it and ate it for dinner.
* Cutting up a US flag and using it to clean the bathroom
* Brother and sister kissing each other and/or having non-reproductive intercourse
* Others involving cannibalism
* A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a chicken.  But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it.  Then he cooks it and eats it.

Is this *morally* wrong? Hard to say. Definitely taboo! And maybe for good reason! 

But "I think it's disgusting and they shouldn't have done it, but I don't know that it's <u>morally</u> wrong" is a weak statement.

From that framework, easy to see why right wing may see lefties as immoral.

### Other dumbfoundings 
([source](http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/haidt.bjorklund.working-paper.when-intuition-finds-no-reason.pub603.pdf))
* The participant is asked to drink from a glass of juice both before and after a sterilized cockroach has been dipped into it. 
* The participant is offered two dollars to sign a piece of paper and then rip it up; on the paper are the words "I, (participant's name), hereby sell my soul, after my death, to Scott Murphy, for the sum of two dollars." *At the bottom of the page a note was printed that said: "this is not a legal or binding contract"*

## What makes a moral?
* Authority (vs independence)
* Fairness / Harm
* Strong Condemnation (e.g. smoking, soul example above)
* Universal applicability (unsure about this one)

## Values by Politics[^1] (see note)
[source (March 2023)](https://moralfoundations.org/)

### Left
* Care / Harm (kindness, gentleness, nurturance)
* Fairness / cheating (justice, rights, autonomy)
	* Sometimes (but not always) considered to be about equality as well.
		* The preferred term is "proportionality", which conservatives also endorse.

### Right
* Fairness / Harm
* Loyalty / Betrayal (self sacrifice for the group, patriotism, one for all, all for one)
* Authority / Subversion (leadership, followership, deference for authority, **respect for traditions**)
* Sanctity / degradation (disgust, contamination, living in an elevated, noble, less carnal way. "body is a temple" (an idea not unique to religion!))
	* See also flag example, above 
	* See also roach example, above
	
The right cares about more things and balances them! The left "only" cares about fairness and harm.


#### A sixth value?
(possibly) Liberty / Oppression (resentment towards dominators and those restricting liberty)
* Hatred of bullies
* At odds with authority
* Unions?


[Another source](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/five-foundations-theory-and-twitter/) discussing the 5 moral foundations and how they split by conservatives vs liberals (Labour), with a focus on how this manifests on Twitter

> The findings are in line with what Haidt anticipates. The Labour account tweeted marginally more about care (50% vs 48%) and a lot more fairness (49% vs 30%). Whereas the Conservative feed featured far more references to loyalty (54% vs 28%) plus authority (78% vs 19%). Note that both foundations were even alluded to in the party moto: “strong and stable leadership in the national interest”. And although neither profile posted often about purity, this was also a more frequent topic on the Tory one (11% vs 8%).
