How to pitch to a publisher

Ryan Dancey is the creator of Legend of the 5 Rings IP, big designer of 3.5, responsible for Wizards buying TSR, and the COO of AEG, the board game publisher behind Smash Up, Romance of the Nine Empires, and more.

Can self publish!

Right now in the board game community there's a flight to Quality.
	Partially because games are more expensive
	And people lived through the golden age of cheap + good
	And pandemic means there's a backlog of fine games sitting unplayed


Quality bar is RISING
	A game that would have been good 5 years ago is just…. Fine now

How submit a pitch?

-   Look for official website submission page / form / rules
-   Look for point of contact email or twitter
-   Watch for announcements on public channels

KNOW THE PUBLISHER

\# of unique art pieces. 200 is  much harder sell than 30.
-   Non standard components
-   Box with cards are the easiest to produce, but there's lots of these
-   Any non standard components or trays
	-   Any considerations to make this a great experience for the player from set up to tear down?
-  ⭐  ==A unique widget? This is a BIG PLUS --- IF the game depends on it.
	-   This is also the kind of thing you *need* a publisher for, and they like it.

## Sell Sheets

- One page
-  Picture of game
-  # of players
-  How to win
-  Core mechanic
-  Why is this game awesome
-  Just make this sheet good enough, don't perfect. Seriously don't spend hours on it.
	-   Quality of this sheet is never a consideration
-   Give them a reason to say yes

Make a 5 minute video of you piching.
	The RUNDOWN (see below)
	This video will get you a lot of "no"s
	But the yeses you get are stronger, it's a great filter
	No production value, just you explaining what's going on and what the game is.

Website
-   Clever small explainer site
-   With pitch
-   This is unusual, but very compelling
-   Only do this if you can make it in house, don't spend money hiring someone


## THE RUNDOWN

Or elevator pitch
NO presentation
Just, <2 minutes
No lore
Who are you?
	You're a train baron in the 1800s
Primary game mechanic
	Deck builder plus….
How win?
	Not have the most VP, but what triggers the end game etc.
⭐ ==What's the coolest thing that happens in your game?==
	This is the most important. What's the cool moment!


## Playing your prototype (during a pitch)

Probably not happening during a pitch
Maybe simulate a turn or two
Might do a demo for some time (e.g. 20 minutes)
MAY be a full play
⭐ ==Package the board game for quick setup and play. Seriously.

## POST PITCH FOLLOW UP
-   Email 2 weeks after
	-   + sell sheet
	-   Thank for time + taking pitch
	-   Wait
	-   Please get back when you have time thanks
-   Could take ~3 months
-   Getting a YES is hard. Very hard.
-   Getting a maybe is easier.
-   Can sit in limbo indefinitely


## BUY vs HOLD  
HOLD is giving you money to maintain the right to stew exclusively.
Usually a year to stew. Can be negotiated down (6 months)
OR BUY
	Means they want to publish
	Usually a license to publish, not buying the game outright
	Gives an advance
		Usually ~$5k
	Can negotiate to keep the trademark
		(otherwise if they pick the name they get to keep it and you don't have much just mechanics)
