This is a place for thoughts. 

Some are still growing, others are well-nurtured. You can get a sense of how well nurtured an item is by its icon.

### Dead Links
You may find some links don't go anywhere. These are private notes that are still germinating. I am happy to discuss my nascent thoughts on these topics with friends, but they are not far enough along that I feel comfortable displaying them publicly until I have a better understanding. ==Often these are topics where a lack of understanding can lead to a lack of empathy.== 

Other times a dead link is a placeholder, and I haven't gotten around to filling it out yet.
