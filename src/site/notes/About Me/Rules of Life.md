1. You've got to be kind, gotta look out for other people.

2. No one will ever give you permission to start creating, so stop waiting for it. If you're waiting to write or to express yourself fully, stop it. Just do it. No one can stop you and no one will (explicitly) bless you before you've done it. So go do it.

If you make an enemy for making something authentic, that person was never going to be your friend.
