I've been to a lot of presentations at conferences that are presented as 100-level courses. These are invariably useless.

They generally fall into one of two failure states:
1. ==The person giving the presentation is so familiar with the topic, they assume the audience is as well.== They fill it with facts and figures that are meaningless to the general public. They blaze through material, leaving no one the wiser for having heard it.
2. ==2. It's truly a 100-level course, filled with overviews and levelsetting, to the point where there is no takeaway.== It's a course of the symbolism in Dracula that starts by explaining what the book is about, or worse, what is a novel, and how would one read one.

> [!tip] Takeaways
**Audience**: Skip the 100, go to the 200s
**Presenters**: If it's a 100, give the minimum context and the results. Skip the details. Consider giving a 200 instead, and assuming a little from the audience. Run your talk by someone outside your field and see if it's comprehensible and engaging.
