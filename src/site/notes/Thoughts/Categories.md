> [!Tip] Takeaway
>  Categories, like models, are useful tools. Some categories are very broad, such that they could encompass everything. Putting something outside of a category in some contexts does not make it a less valid member of that category.

## Art and Politics

### Art

- Everytthing is art
- Creating a definition of art only exists to create a world with less art
	- I don't want to work towards that world, and find it hard to sympathize with those who would.
- Some things are more explicitly art than others
	- When playing 20 questions I will often ask "Is the person an artist (narrow)?", meaning a painter, sculptor, animator, or similar
		- This does not mean that wide art is less valid, only that there are contexts where categories are useful
- I like art that strives to make the user feel something, and art that can do that on its own, without additional context.

### Politics

* Everything is political.
* Some things are more explicitly political than others
	* Things directly related to governing: elections, laws, politicians
	* Restrictions and regulations that affect a class of people
* Saying "I don't discuss politics" is not *meaningless* just because "everything is political"
* What you consider to be *apolitical* reflects your own beliefs. Those are the topics that are in the water around you; you cannot see them.
	* "There are two races, white and political."
