*Note: I've put off writing this for long enough that I've decided to put down very very rough thoughts. I may return to this and flesh it out.*

Consumerism is buying things just to own them, forgetting that when you die you can't take it with you.

It's better to spend your money on *experiences* than things. Especially since (see [[Misc/Interesting/Hedonic Treadmill\|Hedonic Treadmill]]), we adjust to *things* and no longer take joy in them. 

Don't tie your happiness and well-being to the purchase of goods, to *having* more stuff than the other guy. 

It's hard, I get it. But material possessions and consumer goods quickly become *clutter*. It feels good to get rid of things, it feels good to have a space that is empty and easy to use. 

Items stress me out.

George Carlin once said that your stuff is *stuff*, other people's stuff is *things* or *shit*. A house is just a place for your stuff.

I like to keep items that facilitate experiences. Board games, books, the like. Even then, I have more than I need. 

Paring down. Borrow and lend. Not mine, ours. 

Libraries are grand.
