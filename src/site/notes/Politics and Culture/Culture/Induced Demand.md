## Induced Demand

Most commonly associated with roads.

The more you add of something, the more people want to use it.

Adding more roads doesn't decrease traffic, it INCREASES it. 

The more you improve transportation infrastructure, the more it releases "pent up" latent demand.

If you want more bikes, remove car-streets and build bike-roads.
