## Ask Culture vs Guess Culture

Asking culture is upfront, direct, and generally okay with saying no and being told no. If you want something, you simply ask for it without an expectation of any particular answer. Other people are Guessers, and in "guess culture," you don't ask for things unless you're quite sure the answer will be yes
