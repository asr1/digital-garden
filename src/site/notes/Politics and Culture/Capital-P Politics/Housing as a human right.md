# Housing as a human right

Humans cannot live without shelter or without food. If we believe that humans have a right to life, they must also have a right to food and shelter.

We are the only species on the planet that pays to live here.

But it doesn't have to be this way. 

Our governments could provide housing to everyone. To make sure that no one is homeless except by choice.

We don't.
