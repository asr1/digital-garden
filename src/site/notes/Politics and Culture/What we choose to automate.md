# What we choose to automate

With the rise of AI we're seeing people say they can now crap out a book or a painting and have more time to make MONEY!

We're automating away the parts of human existence that foster connection, that enable knowing others and being known. 

If we automate labor, we can spend more time enjoying life, creating art that speaks to our human experiences.

Instead we're creating soulless recreations that wear the trappings of art at the press of a button and still spending 8 hours a day toiling and laboring in increasingly meaningless ways. 

It's the worst of both worlds.
