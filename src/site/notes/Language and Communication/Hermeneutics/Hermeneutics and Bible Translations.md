Every translation of the bible is a series of choices. What you read today cannot be the one true canonical Truth, but it's worth knowing why translators made the choices they made.

And this extends further than the bible. Cervantes argues that reading a translation is a waste of time, as you lose everything the author wanted to say. 

Some authors translate their own books, and say that certain languages capture their intent best. Milan Kundera says of The Book of Laughter and Forgetting that the English translation is closest to his true intent, despite it not being the one he wrote first.
