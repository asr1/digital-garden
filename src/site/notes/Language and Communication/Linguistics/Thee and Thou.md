## Difference

_Thee_, _thou_, and _thine_ (or _thy_) are Early Modern English second person singular pronouns. _Thou_ is the subject form (nominative), _thee_ is the object form, and _thy/thine_ is the possessive form.

Before they all merged into the catch-all form _you_, English second person pronouns distinguished between nominative and objective, as well as between singular and plural (or formal):

> _thou_ - singular informal, subject (_Thou art here._ = _You are here._)  
> _thee_ - singular informal, object (_He gave it to thee._)  
> _ye_ - plural or formal, subject  
> _you_ - plural or formal, object



## Familiar, Offensive (don't thee thou me, thee thou thissen)

*From: https://english.stackexchange.com/a/118058/146585*
‘Thou’ is historically perceived in Yorkshire (England) as being disrespectful, or over-familiar in a formal context, e.g. if used to address a teacher, or upon greeting a stranger… However, ‘thee’ is perceived to be more respectful, as with the French usage of the words ‘vous’ and ‘tu’, of which ‘tu’ is regarded as offensive if used inappropriately (another conversation altogether). Barnsley folk are especially well know for having the bad habit of using ‘thou’, including one instance I’ve heard of with a French teacher, who mistakenly believed it to be endearing, and quickly chastised her pupils once she was put in the picture.

A classic Yorkshire phrase, often attributed to Ossett:

==_Don't thee thou me, thee thou thissen, and 'ow tha likes thee thouing==._ (Don't you thou me, you thou yourself, and see how you like it!)
