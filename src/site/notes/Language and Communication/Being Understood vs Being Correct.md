It's far more important to be understood than it is to be correct. 

Is a brontosaurus a dinosaur? [It's complicated](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/brontosaurus-reinstating-a-prehistoric-icon.html) But the fact is many people won't know what a sauropod is.

There are times when it's okay to be wrong. There's a difference between *appealing* to the lowest common denominator and *communicating* to the same. 

## Language

My speech coach used to say that anything can be a word. The purpose of language is to convey meaning, and if meaning is conveyed, you did it. If I ask you to open the *grinad* and you understand that by *grinad* I mean door, I've communicated. Is *grinad* a  word now? Why not?

I'm a strong descriptivist, and every dictionary says they are as well. That is, the dictionary does not prescribe how words can be used (prescriptivism), they describe how they *are* being used. Languages evolve and change. Should you use *grinad* to mean door? Probably not!

Just like how you might alter your vocabulary depending on whether you're speaking to a child, an expert, or a peer.
