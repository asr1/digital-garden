There's a popular myth that says that the size of the space shuttle was  dictated by the limitations of carrying the shuttle over rail, specifically that there was a single tunnel (usually with a location given as Utah) that the booster would have to pass through.


## The Truth

This is mostly an urban legend, though it's based in fact:

Transport by rail *influenced* (but did not dicate) the booster designs. The diameter of the shuttle boosters (12 feet) is larger than the largest train diameter (called load gauge), but we reguarly ship things bigge than that, and have to dismantle things to do it. Tunnels cannot be dismantled, so there are hard limits, but it's hard to point to a specific tunnel. (source: [stackExchange](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/4066/26048))
