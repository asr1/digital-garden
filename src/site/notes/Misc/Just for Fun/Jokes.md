## The Counterfeiters
Two counterfeiters were admiring the latest bills. One turned to the other and said "You fool! You printed a $25 bill! No one will accept this!"

"Not so!" Said his partner. "There's a shake stand down by the beach, the guy who runs it will accept ANYTHING! Try it yourself. Go down there and make change for this bill, you won't be disappointed!" 

The counterfeiter went down to the beach and returned a few minutes later. "Well, the good news is you were right. He took the bill. The bad news is he gave me back three $7s and $4!"
