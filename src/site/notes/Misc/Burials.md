## Do you know how deep a grave is?

*Note: by 'we' I mean the United States*

It's not 6 feet, but I wouldn't blame you for thinking it.

It's actually 4'11. 

Why? Because of OSHA.

If you have a hole 5 feet deep or lower, it requiers shoring (reinforcements).

So graves are just shallow enough to avoid this requirement.

*Related: buring a body too deep actually retards decomposition.*

## Do you know why we started burying bodies 6 feet deep?

It's because of the plague. Specifically, the London plague of 1665. 

Burying people shallower than this leads to problems with grave robbers, the local water table, and [[Thoughts/Don't Eat Pork#Don't Eat Pork\|wildlife digging up graves]].
