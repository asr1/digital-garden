# Lost Bioware DLC

Bioware lost the source code to Pinnacle Station, one of the DLC expansions to Mass Effect. It was created by a vendor studio (Demiurge Studios).

So when they released Mass Effect Legendary, this DLC wasn't included. There were backups, sure, but those were corrupted as well.

Here's the joke: modders added it back in.
