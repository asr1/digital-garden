Here's a controversial take:

Not everything needs a secure password. 

I use WhenIsGood to schedule virtual playtests of [[Reading and Writing/Cyberrats\|Cyberrats]] and other Roleplaying games. 

I used to use SurveyMonkey to store responses about which breakfast cereal mascot would win in a fight.

These don't need to be secure. The only purpose a password provides is to ensure that I can access my own data. 

There is ZERO threat risk of someone else finding this out.

Hell, I'll give my library card and pin to anyone who asks.

A more security-minded person might argue that this is a case for OAuth, where I can log into an account via Twitter, Facebook, or Google. Sure, fine. Whatever. It probably is. That's not the point I'm making.
