Code is increasingly complex and we understand less and less of the tools we build upon.

Once upon a time, video games shipped with their own operating systems. Now applicaitons run on web browsers that run on  operating systems. No one person understands all of the abstractions they use.

Once, we cared about storage space, and we fought for every bit and byte. Now, we assume the user has an unlimited amount of storage, and are even blas√© about RAM. 
- You can see this in video games, where sizes are commonly in the 2-or-3-digit GB range.
- There's a weird counter-effect, where some gamers feel ripped off by games that are "only" 3 GB in size, falsely correlating size with quality.
