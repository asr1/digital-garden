# (Skip The) 100 level courses

I've been to a lot of presentations at conferences that are presented as 100-level courses. These are invariably useless.

They generally fall into one of two failure states:
1. ==The person giving the presentation is so familiar with the topic, they assume the audience is as well.== They fill it with facts and figures that are meaningless to the general public. They blaze through material, leaving no one the wiser for having heard it.
2. ==It's truly a 100-level course, filled with overviews and levelsetting, to the point where there is no takeaway.== It's a course on the symbolism in Dracula that starts by explaining what the book is about, or worse, what is a novel, and how would one read one.

> [!tip] Takeaways
**Audience**: Skip the 100, go to the 200s
**Presenters**: If it's a 100, give the minimum context and the results. Skip the details. Consider giving a 200 instead, and assuming a little from the audience. Run your talk by someone outside your field and see if it's comprehensible and engaging.

## Aside:
I can't remember if it was John Carmack or Scott Alexander, but I remember reading someone talking about getting invited to a conference of some kind, and thinking it wasn't worth their time, precisely because they expected to be smarter or more knowledgeable than many of the other attendants. As I recall, the times they *did* go they felt like it was actually a good use of time networking, but the initial instinct of "I will be providing more value than I receive" is noteworthy.
