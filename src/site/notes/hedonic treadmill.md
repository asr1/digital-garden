# Hedonic Treadmill

We think new things will make us happy. A new car, a new game. We buy the thing, and for a while, we're happy. Then our baseline happiness adjusts: suddenly we have the new car, the new game... and we're not happy! It wears off, so we need MORE car, MORE game, MORE raise, MORE money.

Maybe this next thing will make us happy, maybe, maybe, maybe.

But it never will. As long as our baseline continues to increase.

So we always keep up with the Joneses, racing unhappiness against unhappiness, each buying a bigger boat, hoping that THIS one will fill the gap. It won't. It can't. Stop.

### Combating the treadmill

So what do we do?

We practice gratitude. We're thankful for what we have. We spend our money on experiences, not on things. We practice [[Minimalism\|Minimalism]]. And we don't buy a thing just to have it.
