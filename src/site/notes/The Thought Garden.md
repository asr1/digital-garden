This is a place for thoughts. 

Some are still growing, others are well-nurtured. You can get a sense of how well nurtured an item is by its icon.

### Dead Links
You may find some links don't go anywhere. These are private notes that are still germinating. I am happy to discuss my nascent thoughts on these topics with friends, but they are not far enough along that I feel comfortable displaying them publicly until I have a better understanding. ==Often these are topics where a lack of understanding can lead to a lack of empathy.== 

Other times a dead link is a placeholder, and I haven't gotten around to filling it out yet.

## Alex Rinehart

Alex Rinehart is a writer, storyteller, and roleplaying game developer. Among his many [[Projects/Projects\|hobbies]] is the desire to bend [[Software and Programming/Software\|Software]] into running in places it was never designed.

This blog is a place for thoughts, stories, and documentations of some of these adventures, as well as tutorials that can help others save time with knowledge shared.

If you like what you see here, or if any of the tutorials have brought you value or saved you time, consider picking upÂ [one of my games](https://alrine.itch.io/).

## Three Beliefs[](https://blog.alexrinehart.net/about/#three-beliefs)

1.  Software is a tool that should be used to save time.
2.  Saved time should be spent doing enjoyable things. Everyone should be working less.
3.  We have to look out for one another where we can.

## Deep Dive

I'm a public speaker and a writer. I write fiction and roleplaying games. By profession, I'm a software engineer and productivity enthusiast. I make tools that make other peoples' lives easier. 

### Being wrong
There's no shame in asking for help or admitting you don't know things. We're all born knowing nothing, and there's only one way to learn.

I too was born knowing nothing, and have all sorts of wrong and half-thought ideas. I keep some of them here, and prune them as I go.

### Tone
I try to practice [[Reading and Writing/Nonviolent Communication\|Nonviolent Communication]] and avoid editorializing. This means instead of saying "SEA-TAC is a bad airport", I will say something like "the last three times I've been to SEA-TAC, I've had to wait more than 90 minutes in the line for security. This does not my needs for autonomy."

### Talks
I've given talks on the following topics:
- The importance of storytelling
	- We connect with stories and remember experiences
- Working in large codebases
- Designing inclusive software through exclusivity
	- Make fewer assumptions, and restrict users only by technical limitations
