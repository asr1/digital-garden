## Life Goals

I find joy and delight when I can save others time, share my knowledge and skills, or create ejoyment, pleasaure, and a distraction from the unplesaant parts of life. 

I've pursued a career in software automation: I build tools that help other people save time and increase their [[Productivty\|Productivty]], enabling them to enjoy the best parts of life: time spent with friends and family.
