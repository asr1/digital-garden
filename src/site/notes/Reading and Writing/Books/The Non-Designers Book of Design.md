# The Non-Designer's Book of Design 
by Robin Williams


## Overview

### Contrast

Clarifies communication, grabs attention.

Avoid elements that are similar.
If they aren't the same, make them **very different**

Elements:
	* Type
	* Color
	* Size
	* Line thickness
	* Shape
	* Space
	* etc.
	

### Repetition

Strengthens unity, develops organization

Repeat elements throughout the piece

Elements:
	* Colors
	* Shapes
	* Textures
	* Spatial Relatinships
	* Line Thickness
	* Fonts
	* Sizes
	* Graphic concepts
	* Etc.
	
### Alignment

Creates a clean and sophisticated look

Nothing should be placed arbitrarily.

Everything should have a visual connection with another element on the page.

### Proximity

Helps organize info, reduce clutter, and provide structure.

Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. 

When several items are close, they become one visual unit, not several separate ones.



## Proximity

White space is your friend. Don't fill up ever corner.

Scattered pieces are less accessible and unorganized.

**Group related items together**

Move them close so they are seen as one cohevisve group, not a bunch of unrelated bits.

Similarly, items that are NOT related should NOT be close to other elements. This builds organizaiton.

Grouping *related* things also helps organize the white space

**Proximity implies a relationship**

> [!tip] Tip!  
> Always question whether elements are close to the elements they blong with. Watch for elements with inappropriate relationships.

Decrease leading within one group, use space between different groups.

* Whitespace is good
* Indenting is good
* Keep bullets close to their text

## Alignment

**Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily.**
Every time should have a visual connection with something else.

Has to be conscious! Don't just stick things where they fit.

There are 8 ways to set blocks of text copy ([source](https://jamesrobertwatson.com/))
* Flush left Ragged right 
* Flight Right Ragged left
* Centered
* Justified
* Asymmetrical
* Wraparound
* Image Shape
* Flush center

*Flush center is good for signs and similar things*


#### Centering Text

❗ Center alignment can appear weak. Prefer left or right. Gives a strong vertical edge.


You can always center the text, but set the centered bit off from the rest. 

Centered isn't always bad, but use it consciously.

If you **are** going to use it, make it look intentional. 
Intentional and strong.
*If you can't tell instantly that text was centered, don't.*

---

Choose one alignment: Flight left, Flight Right, or Centered.

#### Mixing and Matching alignments

If you must pick multiple, make sure they still line up.

Learn to draw lines between elements.

For example, having flush right text at the bottom that lines up with the right side of flush left text at the top.
