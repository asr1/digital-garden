# The Non-Designer's Book of Design 
by Robin Williams
*fourth edition*


## Overview

### Contrast

Clarifies communication, grabs attention.

Avoid elements that are similar.
If they aren't the same, make them **very different**

Elements:
	* Type
	* Color
	* Size
	* Line thickness
	* Shape
	* Space
	* etc.
	

### Repetition

Strengthens unity, develops organization

Repeat elements throughout the piece

Elements:
	* Colors
	* Shapes
	* Textures
	* Spatial Relatinships
	* Line Thickness
	* Fonts
	* Sizes
	* Graphic concepts
	* Etc.
	
### Alignment

Creates a clean and sophisticated look

Nothing should be placed arbitrarily.

Everything should have a visual connection with another element on the page.

### Proximity

Helps organize info, reduce clutter, and provide structure.

Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. 

When several items are close, they become one visual unit, not several separate ones.



## Proximity

White space is your friend. Don't fill up ever corner.

Scattered pieces are less accessible and unorganized.

**Group related items together**

Move them close so they are seen as one cohevisve group, not a bunch of unrelated bits.

Similarly, items that are NOT related should NOT be close to other elements. This builds organizaiton.

Grouping *related* things also helps organize the white space

**Proximity implies a relationship**

> [!tip] Tip!  
> Always question whether elements are close to the elements they blong with. Watch for elements with inappropriate relationships.

Decrease leading within one group, use space between different groups.

* Whitespace is good
* Indenting is good
* Keep bullets close to their text

## Alignment

**Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily.**
Every time should have a visual connection with something else.

Has to be conscious! Don't just stick things where they fit.

There are 8 ways to set blocks of text copy ([source](https://jamesrobertwatson.com/))
* Flush left Ragged right 
* Flight Right Ragged left
* Centered
* Justified
* Asymmetrical
* Wraparound
* Image Shape
* Flush center
![Body Text Options.png](/img/user/img/Body%20Text%20Options.png)
*Flush center is good for signs and similar things*


#### Centering Text

❗ Center alignment can appear weak. Prefer left or right. Gives a strong vertical edge.


You can always center the text, but set the centered bit off from the rest. 

Centered isn't always bad, but use it consciously.

If you **are** going to use it, make it look intentional. 
Intentional and strong.
*If you can't tell instantly that text was centered, don't.*

---

Choose one alignment: Flight left, Flight Right, or Centered.

#### Mixing and Matching alignments

If you must pick multiple, make sure they still line up.

Learn to draw lines between elements.

For example, having flush right text at the bottom that lines up with the right side of flush left text at the top.

#### Connecting things

Make sure every item has visual alignment with another item.

* If lines of text are across from one another, align their baselines
* If there are separate blocks of text, align left or right edge
* Align graphic elements' edges to other edges on the page

With intentionality!

**Lack of alignment is the biggest cause of unappealing documents!**


>[!danger] Warning
>Never center a headline over flush left body OR over text with an indent. 
>If the body doesn't have a strong left and right edge, you can't tell the headline is centered, and it looks random.

- Don't indent first paragraphs. 
	- The purpose of the indent is to tell you there's a new graf. The first one is obvious.
- Indents should be on em (~2 spaces), not 5.
- Align photos with an edge and/or baseline.

❗ Find a strong line and use it.

> “Try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose.” 
> – Arthur Howitzer Jr., the French Dispatch

If your alignment is strong, you can consciously break them, and it will look intentional.

Don't be a wimp. Go all the way or not at all.

❗ You must know what the rule is before you break it

Again, think of the French Dispatch:


>One way to tell if a modern artist actually knows what he’s doing is to get him to paint you a horse, or a flower, or a sinking battleship or something that’s actually supposed to look like the thing that it’s actually supposed to look like. Can he do it?
>– Julian Cadazio

"The point is, he could paint this beautifully if he wanted, but he thinks this is better."

## Repetition

 **Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.**

Could be:
- Bold font
- Thick line
- Certain bullet
- Design element
- Color
- Format
- Shape
- Spatial relationship, etc.
- Anything a reader will visually recognize

You already do this a little (consistent heading styles, same bullets, half-inch bottom rule, etc.) but push it *further*

You want consistency.

My pal [Sean](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain)once advised me that each page in a zine should clearly relate to the page before or after. This book goes further: each page in a zine should be clear they belong to the same zine.

See also uniforms (a kind of repetition that demonstrates a relationship)

Start with headlines and subheads; likely already consistent. Make them *bold* (as in striking, not necessarily as in, you know. Font weight).

Add color , size. Make it a *design* element, not just a useful one.

>[!tip] Consistency
>If you have consistency, you have have surprises by drawing attention to things that break the consistency.
>
>If nothing is consistent, you can't call attention to anything.

You can add something new (clip art, picture font) just for the sake of repetition.

OR take a simple element and use it in various ways (vary color, angle, size, etc.)

Might not be the *same* object, but related enough to establish a clear connection.

>[!tip]
General: Avoid borders

Make it look intentional, not random.

You can unify multiple pieces by either overlapping them with a design element, or pulling one outside of a border. 

Repetition:
- Adds visual interest
- Elevates unity
- Ties together separate parts

1 page useful, multi page critical (consistency)

> [!tip]
> Go further than you think! Make things more dramatic, stronger, sharper!

Strengthen existing ones or create new ones. Get wild, get zany, have fun!

#### Beware:
- Don't repeat so much it becomes annoying or overwhelming

## Contrast

Be strong, don't wimp out.

**Contrast various elements to draw a reader's eye into the page.**

If two things aren't **exactly** the same, make them extremely different.

Contrast helps:
- Draw the eye
- Organize info
- Clarify hierarchy
- Provide focus
- Guide the reader's attention

Create contrast with:
- Large / small font sizes
- Oldstyle font + sans serif font
- Thin / thick lines
- Cool color + warm color
- Smooth + rough texture
- Horizontal element (e.g. long line of text) + Vertical element (tall narrow column of text)
- Widely spaced / closely packed lines
- large / small graphic

>[!danger] Don't wimp out
>If two elements are sort of different but not really, you've made CONFLICT not contrast.

A 14-point font is not that different from a 12-point font. C'mon now. 

Neither different enough are black and dark brown or a 1/2 point line and a 1 point line. Be different!

---

Strong, bold typefaces, alternating caps and lowercase, COLOR.


Alignment: You can use the same alignment (left) without always aligning to the same edge. 

Stronger the contrast, less risk of someone thinking it's a mistake.

Again, elements cannot be similar!

---

## Design With Color

### Use a color wheel

#### Complements

Colors on opposite sides are **complements**. Use one as the main color, one as an accent.

Even if they seem weird (lime green + violet, aqua and red-orange, etc.)

#### Triads

3 equidistant colors from the wheel form a triad. Red, yellow, blue is the **primary triad**.

Secondary triad is red-orange, lime-green, bluish-purple.

Can also do orange, green, purple or yellow-orange, aqua, violet. 

#### Split Complement

Choose a color from one side, find its opposite (complement), but instead of the complement, take the colors on either side!

This givers yellow, violet, bluish-purple or green, red-orange, violet.

#### **Analogous colors** 
Three colors next to each other. This also works!
Yellow-orange, orange, red-orange or aqua, green, lime-green

### Shades and Tints

A **hue** is the pure color. But if you mix in a little black or white, you get a shade or a tint.

❗
- Add black to make a shade
- Add white to make a tint

This can help, for example, avoid Christmas or Halloween vibes of red + green or black + orange.

A **monochromatic** scheme is a single hue plus any number of corresponding tints and shades.

In software, you get tints by going towards the middle of the color picker circle, and shades by using the darkness slider.

### Tones

Tone is brightness, deepness or hue of a color. You want variety here, to keep up contrast. 

### Warm vs Cool Colors

Cool colors recede, warm colors pop forward.
Use less hot if combining, it's profound. Like spices.
Warm up a color by adding red or yellow, cool down by adding various blues.

Don't try to make them have equal weight! Take advantage of pop and fade to draw eyes where you want them.

### CMYK vs RGB 

> [!tip] CMYK vs RGB
> Use CMYK for anything that will be printed, RGB for anything viewed on a screen.

* Edit images in RGB, change to CMYK as the last step
* As your printer (if they aren't a 4-color printing press) whether they prefer RGB or CMYK

## Tips and Tricks (designing newspapers, brochures, flyers, letterhead, business cards and more)

* Repetition is critical in branding, even across products. Make a mark.
* 
### Business Cards

* Business cards can be vertical, and full color both sides. 
	* PrintPlace.com is cheap?
	* Leave room for notes if you use full bleed on one side: people like to write on them
	* Eliminate everything that isn't CRITICAL. It's not a brochure
	* Don't label URL, Phone, Email. It's evident.
	* Use smaller text size! 9 or 8 or even 7 is great.

### Flyers

* You can go wild on flyers. 
	* Use off-the-wall typefaces
	* You're competing for attention here (unlike a business card or letterhead)
	* Make headlines and images HUGE Or go minimalist with a single line of tiny text in the middle. Something that makes people notice.
	* You can have small body, if you can grab their attention first.
	* CONTRAST CONTRAST CONTRAST
		* And hierarchy. "If everything is important, nothing is" (that's the plot of the Incredibles).
	* Focal point! Strong, contrasting subheads.
	* White space is good, but don't let it become "trapped" by other elements.
* Make something you'd like to read. Playful is good! Use color!

### Ads
* Keep the copy simple and short
	* Headlines are the lifeblood! More important than design
	* Use white space! Note where the eyes go!
	* Clever, clear, brief.
		* Tell them what do do and how to do it.
	* Avoid crowding. It's okay to have blank space!
	* Contrast! White space does this easily!
		* Other ads are so busy yours will stand out
	* Small fonts make serifs disappear, especially in print
		* Similarly avoid reverse type (white text on dark background) unless you KNOW that your typeface doesn't have thin lines. Ink spreads, yo.

### Resumes

If sending digitally, can do a horizontal layout!

Contrast is key! Also alignment, avoid center, tsk tsk.

Keep bullets close to items, keep headings close to related info. Just like always!

## Typography

*If there's no typefaces, it's not graphic design*

❗ Communication is key! Aesthetics come second. 

Essential rules
- Use smart quotes
- ONE space after a period
- Punctuation and quotes:
	- Periods and commas **always** go inside the quotes.
	- Colons and semicolons go outside
	- ? and ! go inside if they're part of the quote, or outside if they don't.
	- Multiple quoted paragraphs, " goes at the start of every graf, but only at the end of the final
- Apostrophes are always shaped like a 9, never like a 6 (always "closing" quote, never opening).
- Use -, – and — appropriately. 👍
	- em dashes don't use space on either side. *can* kern some space, but just enough to not bump.
- CAPITAL LETTERS slow down reading speed by having a uniform "coastline" of shape.
	- Make sure this is an intentional choice.
- **Never** underline.
	- Bold, larger, different font, color, or combination.
	- If you must, use a rule that doesn't bump the descenders of the letters OR make it look intentional.
- **Widows** are when the last line of a paragraph has fewer than 7 characters. This is bad. WORSE is having part of a word and having the last line be just part of a hyphenated word.
- **Orphans** are when the last line of a word is at the top of a new column or page. Also bad.
- Adjust tracking or copy to fix both.

### Misc

- Punctuation should match. If you have a word that's italic, bold, or in a different font, the following punctuation should be the same style. **This applies to bold colons!**
- Parens: if the whole parenthetical stands alone, the . goes inside. Otherwise it goes outside.
- Paragraph indents should be one em, not 1/2 an inch, not 5 spaces. One em. —
- Use either space between grafs or an indent, not both.
- Don't indent the first graf.
- If you must set text inside a box., leave much padding. 
- Bullets, not hyphens! Or a wingding!

### Combining Typefaces

*Per Clayton Notestine, the secret to fantastic RPG layout is great Typography ([source](https://twitter.com/ClayNotestine/status/1669087206290386944)). He's also said that the #1 trick to great TTRPG visual design is remixing, stealing, and mimicking ([source](https://twitter.com/ClayNotestine/status/1354867271387271170)).*

3 types of relationship:
- Concordant
	- No variety. It's formal, if a bit dull. 
	- One type family, little variety in style, size, weight, etc.
- Conflicting
	- Similar typefaces, not exactly the same. 
	- Disturbing, like a little contrast but not enough. 
	- Is it intentional? Who can say.
- Contrasting!
	- Bold, brash, great
	- Clearly distinct typefaces intentionally mixed.

#### Concordant

Not bad, just bland and formal. Use some italic, maybe vary the size a little. It works.

This is playing it safe. 

Do it consciously. 

#### Conflict

2 or more typefaces that are similar, but not different enough. 

You don't want to try to match with something similar. It'll look like a mistake. 

The similarities fight. 

Avoid always. 

#### Contrast

Fun!

Make it **obvious**. "Whatever you write, try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose."

- Size
- Weight
- Structure
- Form
- Direction
- Color

It's not the differences that cause problems, it's the similarities!

**Don't be a wimp!**


### Typefaces

Key to combining is to understand similarities and differences. 

Broadly 6 categories. 
*of course there are exceptions. Categories are useful. See also [[Reading and Writing/Books/Women Fire And Dangerous Things\|Women Fire And Dangerous Things]]*

- Oldstyle
- Modern
- Slab Serif
- Sans Serif
- Script
- Decorative
	- Including Grungy

#### Oldstyle

Based on scribal handwriting.
Angled Serifs
Diagonal stress

(stress is the line between thinnest parts of curved strokes)

Rarely any distinguishing characteristics. 

Good for body copy.

- Times
- Garamond
- Goudy
- Bell 
- etc

#### Modern

Mechanical.
Thin, horizontal serifs.
Radical thick/thin transition
Vertical stress

Cold, elegant

Striking when large. 
Headline, not good for body. 


- Bodoni
- Didot
- Walbaum
- Modern No. 20


#### Slab Serif

Little thick/thin transition
Made the thin parts of modern thicker.
Used in advertising.

Very readable
Good for children's books
Darker page, easy to see at a distance.

- New Century Schoolbook
- Memphis
- Clarendon

#### Sans Serif

No serifs
Often no thin/thick transition; same thickness all around

- Folio
- Modernica Light
- Brandon Grotesque
- Transat Text

Don't use Arial or Helvetica or Verdana, use a sans serif family that includes a strong, heavy, black face. Like those above. They have weights that go from light to extra black.

Eye-catching!

Often used for screens / digital work.

> [!warning] Combining with sans serif
> It can be tricky to combine with sans serif fonts, especially those like Optima which have stresses. Why? The similarities!
> 
> Thick / thin strokes are similar to serif
> Lack of serif looks more like other sans serif.
> So be careful if your sans serif fonts have thick/thin transitions (i.e. stresses)!

#### Script

Look handlettered with calligraphy pen

Lots of subcategories (connect / don't, hand printing, traditional calligraphic, etc.)

Use them **sparingly**, and never as blocks of text and NEVER NEVER as all caps.

Use them large!

- Peory
- Adorn Bouquet
- Bookeyed Sadie
- Emily Austin
- Thirsty Rough Light

#### Decorative

NOT for body copy.

Fun, distinctive, whimsical.

Limited use.

- Matchwood
- The Wall
- Horst Scarlett
- Sybil Green
- Flyswim (!)


Go beyond initial impression: if one strikes you as informat, use it in a formal situation. If you get wild west vibes, try it in corporate or flower shops (?)

They can carry emotions, including very different connotations than your first impression. (???)

Great for like instagram style aphorism posts.

#### In all things, be intentional

Keep your eyes open, and state the problems in words. You can't solve them until you can state them!

Look for things like x-height and descendors!

Start noticing!

### Combining Typefaces

All about contrasts:

- Size
- Weight
- Structure
- Form
- Direction
- Color

Contrasts enhance communication AND aesthetics

## Takeaways

Contrasting typefaces is the basis of all great graphic design.

- Find the most important element and emphasize it.
- Group info into logical groups
	- Use proximity and **space** to set them apart and connect them
	- Don't use boxes!
- Find elements you can repeat
- Add contrast

- Don't be a wimp
	- Use blank space!
		-  White space is good, but don't let it become trapped by other elements.
	- Be asymmetric, uncenter your format. Be unexpected!
	- Make words LARGE or very small
	- Make your graphics bold or minimal, as long as it reinforces the whole

- Use EITHER extra space between paragraphs or an intent (one em) but NOT both! 
	- And never indent the first paragraph!

## Things to Lose

* Centered alignment
* The fonts:
	* Helvetica
	* Times New Roman
	* Arial
	* Sand
 * Boxes and borders
