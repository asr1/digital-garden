Scott on #SSC reviews the book Zero to One

Was Amazon inevitable? Or should be be grateful to Jeff Bezos?

> We are perhaps glad that there is convenient online retail, but this does not translate into appreciation of Jeff Bezos. Online retail came into being because it’s a part of Progress; Jeff Bezos is just some annoying guy who claimed credit and captured the profits.
> 
> (the obvious counterargument here seems to be that if Jeff Bezos didn’t do the admittedly hard work of creating an online retail giant, somebody else would have, perhaps a little later and a little worse; hundred billion dollar bills don’t lie on the sidewalk literally forever. I’m not sure what Thiel thinks of this; at the very least he might say our society fails to appreciate that _some specific person_ does have to do the work for the work to happen.)


Why do we even care about money?

> Think about what happens when successful entrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money? In a financialized world, it unfolds like this:
> 
> – The founders don’t know what to do with it, so they give it to a large bank.  
> – The bankers don’t know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it across a portfolio of investors.  
> – Institutional investors don’t know what to do with their managed capital, so they diversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks.  
> – Companies try to increase the share price by generating free cash flows. If they do, they issue dividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats.
> 
> At no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually _prefer_ indefinite optionality; money is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.
