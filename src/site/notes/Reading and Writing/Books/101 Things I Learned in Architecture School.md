Design is for a specific person. The more specific, the better. Generic designs are for no one.

Consider making this less than perfectly efficient, if the trip from A to B is interesting or enriching. Put something to take in along the way.

Love constraints. Frame an ugly wall in a window in such a way that makes it a focal point.

Embrace contrast. A tall room looks even taller if it's followed by a short, cramped hallway. Windows look bigger after a bunch of small ones.

But also make the superlative, well, superlative. If you want it tall, make it TALL!

Throw away your good ideas. Interesting ideas are good, but trim away what isn't essential. Save them for another project (or get rid of them altogether). Subject every idea to harsh criticism!

Good, balanced compositions are made by a series of moves and countermoves. These aren't opposites, but complements. A big swirl on an "emphatically regular grid", or several small squares. Single / several, small / large, regular / chaotic. An infinite number of countermoves exist. Use them!

==Struggling to draw something complex? Draw the box it came in, then fill in the details.==

Drawing titles! Use a light-colored chisel highlighter to make lowercase letters, then draw just the outlines of whatever shapes they make in a thin Sharpie. It's a neat effect!

When drawing lines, make strong, confident strokes. If you make a guide line, leave it. Leave a backtick or blot where lines intersect, including on letters. Make letters big and balloony on curves and slanting slightly up on horizontals.
