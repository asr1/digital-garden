I'm being a little flippant with the title, but I just want to hit this note again: perfect is the enemy of good. Get SOMETHING down and iterate on it.

If [Sleazebaggano](https://www.starwars.com/databank/elan-sleazebaggano) is good enough for George Lucas, I guarantee whatever you have down is good enough for a first draft.
