The Cyberrats radio hour is an audio comedy set in the world of [[Reading and Writing/My Writing/Cyberrats\|Cyberrats]].

As a play, I give this one a C+. 

Tippy doesn't serve any grand purpose, there's no real threat. A better play would have things looking hopeless by the act break, until Tippy comes in with an insalubrious offer that our heroes must take in order to succeed. As it stands, the stakes are low.

That's fine.

The audio hour is something I thought of in the shower (where my best ideas come to me) and wrote on a whim. Its goal is to spread Cyberrats to a new audience in a new medium, not to revolutionize the radio drama world, nor to kickstart a career in the same field.

It's *fun*, not [[Thoughts/Categorization#Art\|art]].
