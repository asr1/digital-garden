## Observing without judgment
One of the most powerful skills is being able to observe reality without judgment.

Instead of saying "Bob is a bad soccer player", say "Bob has missed 5 of the last 6 goals he attempted." There is no room for argument here, these are facts.

* Words like "should", "ought to", or "must" are hurtful
* Words like "often" and "always" are imprecise and can come off as judgmental

## Communicating needs
All humans have a set of needs.

I feel X when you Y

Make sure that X is a feeling ("betrayed" is not a feeling. "sad" is).

I feel hurt when you talk to alice and bob without talking to me.

## Showing you care

Ask people what's alive in them.
It doesn't have to be good things. What is bringing you emotion? What is on your mind.

### Compliments

When you compliment or thank someone, tell them what need of yours was met by what they did.
