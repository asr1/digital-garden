# Egg

> “**If there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg, I will stand on the side of the egg.** Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals . . . We are all human beings, individuals, fragile eggs. We have no hope against the wall: it's too high, too dark, too cold. To fight the wall, we must join our souls together for warmth, strength. We must not let the system control us -- create who we are. It is we who created the system.
\ - Haruki Murakami, Jerusalem Prize acceptance speech, 2009

>=="Of course it is," Ben agreed, raising a finger. "But the real question is this: Would you go into the woods?”==

## The First Two

I had a video game professor who once told me, "The first two games you make will suck. They'll be absolutely terrible. So make them as quickly as possible."

It's a mistake to put all of your time and effort into making your masterpiece. You won't get it right the first time, and you'll regret it later.

Frederick Books in his book "The Mythical Man-Month" warns against something similar, saying "beware of a software architect's second project. That's where they want to put all the good ideas they had to cut from the first."
