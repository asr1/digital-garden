# Egg

> “**If there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg, I will stand on the side of the egg.** Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals . . . We are all human beings, individuals, fragile eggs. We have no hope against the wall: it's too high, too dark, too cold. To fight the wall, we must join our souls together for warmth, strength. We must not let the system control us -- create who we are. It is we who created the system.
\ - Haruki Murakami, Jerusalem Prize acceptance speech, 2009

# Painting

> The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint. The greats were great because they'd paint a lot.

## The First Two

I had a video game professor who once told me, "The first two games you make will suck. They'll be absolutely terrible. So make them as quickly as possible."

It's a mistake to put all of your time and effort into making your masterpiece. You won't get it right the first time, and you'll regret it later.

Frederick Books in his book "The Mythical Man-Month" warns against something similar, saying "beware of a software architect's second project. That's where they want to put all the good ideas they had to cut from the first."

## Definition of Art

> I don't think I've ever read a definition for art that wasn't stupid. Generally speaking, when a person constructs a thought-machine of this kind, what they're actually trying to do is determine what _isn't_ art.
> ...
> If this thought-machine had any purpose other than to create a world with less art, I could cut it some slack. But it doesn't. Its entire purpose is to rarify art, controlling expression thereby.
>

## Samuel Vimes Boot Theory Of Economics

> The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an _affordable_ pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that _good_ boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and _would still have wet feet_. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes "Boots" theory of socioeconomic unfairness

## Equality
> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal loaves of bread
> – Anatole France, The Red Lily

# John Wesley
> In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity
> – Probably not John Wesley

The point is clear: as a religion, agree about the essential things, let people choose for themselves on everything else, but above all else, don't be a dick about it.
