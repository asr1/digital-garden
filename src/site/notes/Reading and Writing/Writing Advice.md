## Editing Advice

- Search and replace the following when appropriate: suddenly, started to, seems, that, had, just, simply, down, up, got, then.

- Also avoid: heart thudded, eyes flashed, blood pounded, ears screaming, chest heaving, tears streaking, mouth twisting, and the many other similar expressions. Use them when appropriate, but sparingly. We also see a lot of wry smiles, twitching lips, grinning, and gasping.

- Shifting tenses pulls the reader out of the story. Be careful to keep one tense throughout.

- Limbs are not distinct entities. They are a part of you. My eyes I surveyed the scene. Her hand She felt for the light switch.

- Eye color. People don’t usually notice it outside of intimate situations, and no one ever thinks about their own unprompted.

- When noting actions they must either a) advance the plot or b) reveal character/emotion. Example: pinching the bridge of your nose shows frustration and impatience. Quick-stepping into a shadowed alcove is a plot-related action. The character is hiding… will they be seen? Phrases like “stepping forward” or “I walked down the street” do not create tension, advance the plot, reveal character, or show emotion. Always ask if the action description serves a purpose and you will eliminate unnecessary words. 

- Avoid backstory. There is limited space to tell your tale. Starting with a strong, action-forward scene should not be followed by the character thinking about how it all began when they were a kid.
