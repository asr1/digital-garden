# Moloch

Scott Alexander has a [blog post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) about Allen Ginsberg poem Howl. Moloch is the personification of [[Politics and Culture/Capital-P Politics/Capitalism\|Capitalism]], of machines bigger than any human. I think of the quote from [[Reading and Writing/The Grapes of Wrath\|The Grapes of Wrath]]:

> It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It’s the monster. Men made it, but they can’t control it.


Scott continues:

> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the _Principia Discordia_ where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”
> 
> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”
> 
> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”
> 
> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”
> 
> The implicit question is – ==if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it?== And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”. It’s powerful not because it’s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system _isn’t_ an agent.
