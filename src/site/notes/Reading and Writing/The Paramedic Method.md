From https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paramedic_method.html: 
Professional writers understand the need for clear, concise prose. An industry standard for helping workplace writers achieve user-centered, persuasive, and clear prose is the Paramedic Method. When you use the Paramedic Method, you will reduce your word count by eliminating unnecessary words. The Paramedic Method also helps you activate your sentences by eliminating passive voice and redundancies. The Paramedic Method is an easy to learn, systematic way to make your sentences more persuasive and more user-centered.

Follow the seven steps below to improve the readability of your sentences.

#### THE PARAMEDIC METHOD

1.  Circle the prepositions (of, in, about, for, onto, into)
2.  Draw a box around the "is" verb forms
3.  Ask, "Where's the action?"
4.  Change the "action" into a simple verb
5.  Move the doer into the subject (Who's kicking whom)
6.  Eliminate any unnecessary slow wind-ups
7.  Eliminate any redundancies.
