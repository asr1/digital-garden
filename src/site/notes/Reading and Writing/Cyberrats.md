# Cyberrats

![Cyberrats Cover.png|420](/img/user/img/Cyberrats%20Cover.png)

The premise of Cyberrats is this:
- You are interns at a megacorp. You are also a giant rat (or a swarm of rats, or a rat mind in a human body. Don't sweat the details). 
- Aliens are invading.
- Your bosses have decided this is your problem. Unfortunately, a rival megacorp has the situation under control. UNACCEPTABLE!
- You must sabotage the rival corporation, stop the alien invasion, and make sure your bosses get all the credit.

Cyberrats as a book is a work of corporate satire.

Cyberrats as a game is a tactical roleplaying game.

## Status as Cyberpunk

Cyberrats has been called a work of cyberpunk. 

==I object to that characterization.==

Cyberpunk is about rebelling against the system, it's about destroying yourself in a futile attempt to bring down a megacorp that's so large it barely knows you exist.

Cyberpunk is inherently about rebellion. 

By comparison, Cyberrats is about complacency. You are a cog in the corporate machine. The game doesn't give you the tools to rebel. It wears the trappings of cyberpunk but does not existing within the genre.

The only way you can stop serving the corps is through retirement, and that's not rebellion, that's a tool that the corporations themselves give you!
