# The Grapes of Wrath

Steinbeck comes out swinging in this one, pure anger at the banks and capitalism in general. There's definitely some hand-waviness about native Americans (This is MY land! My grandpa drove out the Indians, my father drove out the snakes, and I won't be driven out by a bank!), but I assume that's historically accurate.

## Quotes

### On human nature and religion

> ==He laid two fingers down in his palm in rhythm, as though he gently placed each word there side by side. “I says, ‘Maybe it ain’t a sin. Maybe it’s just the way folks is. Maybe we been whippin’ the hell out of ourselves for nothin’==.’ An’ I thought how some sisters took to beatin’ theirselves with a three-foot shag of bobwire. An’ I thought how maybe they liked to hurt themselves, an’ maybe I liked to hurt myself. Well, I was layin’ under a tree when I figured that out, and I went to sleep. And it come night, an’ it was dark when I come to. They was a coyote squawkin’ near by. Before I knowed it, I was sayin’ out loud, ==‘The hell with it! There ain’t no sin and there ain’t no virtue. There’s just stuff people do. It’s all part of the same thing. And some of the things folks do is nice, and some ain’t nice, but that’s as far as any man got a right to say.’”== He paused and looked up from the palm of his hand, where he had laid down the words.

### On owning the land and fighting monsters

> “I built it with my hands. Straightened old nails to put the sheathing
> on. Rafters are wired to the stringers with baling wire. It’s mine. I
> built it. You bump it down—I’ll be in the window with a rifle. You even
> come too close and I’ll pot you like a rabbit.”
> 
> “It’s not me. There’s nothing I can do. I’ll lose my job if I don’t do
> it. And look—suppose you kill me? They’ll just hang you, but long
> before you’re hung there’ll be another guy on the tractor, and he’ll
> bump the house down. You’re not killing the right guy.”
> 
> “That’s so,” the tenant said. “Who gave you orders? I’ll go after him.
> He’s the one to kill.”
> 
> “You’re wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told him,
> ‘Clear those people out or it’s your job.’”
> 
> “Well, there’s a president of the bank. There’s a board of directors.
> I’ll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.”
> 
> The driver said, “Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the
> East. The orders were, ‘Make the land show profit or we’ll close you
> up.’”
> 
> “But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don’t aim to starve to
> death before I kill the man that’s starving me.”
> 
> “I don’t know. Maybe there’s nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn’t men at all. Maybe, like you said, the property’s doing it. Anyway I told you my orders.”
> 
> “I got to figure,” the tenant said. “We all got to figure. There’s some
> way to stop this. It’s not like lightning or earthquakes. We’ve got a
> bad thing made by men, and by God that’s something we can change.” 

*There is no one to blame. It's a mindless machine. A machine made by people.*

> Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold.
> 
> ==And all of them were caught in something larger than themselves. Some of them hated the mathematics that drove them, and some were afraid, and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling.==
> 
> If a bank or a finance company owned the land, the owner man said, The Bank — or the Company — needs — wants — insists — must have — as though the Bank or the Company were a monster, with thought and feeling, which had ensnared them. 
> 
> These last would take no responsibility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves, while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time.
> 
> Some of the owner men were a little proud to be slaves to such cold and powerful masters. The owner men sat in the cars and explained. You know the land is poor. You’ve scrabbled at it long enough, God knows.

*The bank can't be reasoned with*

> But — you see, a bank or a company can’t do that, because those creatures don’t breathe air, don’t eat side-meat. They breathe profits; they eat the interest on money. If they don’t get it, they die the way you die without air, without side-meat: It is a sad thing, but it is so. It is
> just so.
> 
> We can’t depend on it. The bank — the monster has to have profits all the
> time. It can’t wait. It’ll die. No, taxes go on. ==When the monster stops growing, it dies.== It can’t stay one size.

*The bank is made by men who hate it*

> We know that—all that. It’s not us, it’s the bank. A bank isn’t like a
> man. Or an owner with fifty thousand acres, he isn’t like a man either.
> That’s the monster.
> 
> Sure, cried the tenant men, but it’s our land. We measured it and broke
> it up. We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if
> it’s no good, it’s still ours. That’s what makes it ours—being born on
> it, working it, dying on it. That makes ownership, not a paper with
> numbers on it.
> 
> We’re sorry. It’s not us. It’s the monster. The bank isn’t like a man.
> 
> Yes, but the bank is only made of men.
> 
> No, you’re wrong there—quite wrong there. The bank is something else than men. ==It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It’s the monster. Men made it, but they can’t control it.==

### AI Art
> He loved the land no more than the bank loved the land. He could admire the tractor — its machined surfaces, its surge of power, the roar of its detonating cylinders; but it was not his tractor.
> 
> Behind the tractor rolled the shining disks, cutting the earth with blades— not plowing but surgery, pushing the cut earth to the right where the second row of disks cut it and pushed it to the left; slicing blades shining, polished by the cut earth. 
> 
> And pulled behind the disks, the harrows combing with iron teeth so that the little clods broke up and the earth lay smooth. Behind the harrows, the long seeders — twelve curved iron penes erected in the foundry, orgasms set by gears, raping methodically, raping without passion. 
> 
> The driver sat in his iron seat and he was proud of the straight lines he did not will, proud of the tractor he did not own or love, proud of the power he could not control. And when that crop grew, and was harvested, no man had crumbled a hot clod in his fingers and let the earth sift past his fingertips. No man had touched the seed, or lusted for the growth. 
> 
> Men ate what they had not raised, had no connection with the bread. The land bore under iron, and under iron gradually died; for it was not loved or hated, it had no prayers or curses.


## Breaking Points

> The western land, nervous under the beginning change. The Western States, nervous as horses before a thunder storm. The great owners, nervous, sensing a change, knowing nothing of the nature of the change. The great owners, striking at the immediate thing, the widening government, the growing labor unity; striking at new taxes, at plans; not knowing these things are results, not causes. Results, not causes; results, not causes. ==The causes lie deep and simply—the causes are a hunger in a stomach, multiplied a million times; a hunger in a single soul, hunger for joy and some security, multiplied a million times; muscles and mind aching to grow, to work, to create, multiplied a million times.== The last clear definite function of man—muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need—this is man. To build a wall, to build a house, a dam, and in the wall and house and dam to put something of Manself, and to Manself take back something of the wall, the house, the dam; to take hard muscles from the lifting, to take the clear lines and form from conceiving. For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments.
> 
> This you may say of man—when theories change and crash, when schools, philosophies, when narrow dark alleys of thought, national, religious, economic, grow and disintegrate, man reaches, stumbles forward, painfully, mistakenly sometimes. Having stepped forward, he may slip back, but only half a step, never the full step back. This you may say and know it and know it.
>
>This you may know when the bombs plummet out of the black planes on the market place, when prisoners are stuck like pigs, when the crushed bodies drain filthily in the dust. You may know it in this way. If the step were not being taken, if the stumbling-forward ache were not alive, the bombs would not fall, the throats would not be cut. ==Fear the time when the bombs stop falling while the bombers live—for every bomb is proof that the spirit has not died. And fear the time when the strikes stop while the great owners live—for every little beaten strike is proof that the step is being taken==. And this you can know—fear the time when Manself will not suffer and die for a concept, for this one quality is the foundation of Manself, and this one quality is man, distinctive in the universe. 

## Found Community

> Thus it might be that one family camped near a spring, and another camped for the spring and for company, and a third because two families had pioneered the place and found it good. And when the sun went down, perhaps twenty families and twenty cars were there.  In the evening a strange thing happened: the twenty families became one family, the children were the children of all.  The loss of home became one loss, and the golden time in the West was one dream.
> 
> And it might be that a sick child threw despair into the hearts of twenty families, of a hundred people; that a birth there in a tent kept a hundred people quiet and awestruck through the night and filled a hundred people with the birth-joy in the morning. A family which the night before had been lost and fearful might search its goods to find a present for a new baby.
>  In the evening, sitting about the fires, the twenty were one.
>  
>  They grew to be units of the camps, units of the evenings and the nights.
>  A guitar unwrapped from a blanket and tuned—and the songs, which were all of the people, were sung in the nights. Men sang the words, and women hummed the tunes.  Every night a world created, complete with furniture—friends made and enemies established; a world complete with braggarts and with cowards, with quiet men, with humble men, with kindly men.
>  Every night relationships that make a world, established; and every morning the world torn down like a circus.

### And how it turns to government
*And looking out for one another. A society.*

>At first the families were timid in the building and tumbling worlds, but gradually the technique of building worlds became their technique.  Then leaders emerged, then laws were made, then codes came into being.
> 
  And as the worlds moved westward they were more complete and better furnished, for their builders were more experienced in building them.
  The families learned what rights must be observed—the right of privacy in the tent; the right to keep the past black hidden in the heart; the right to talk and to listen; the right to refuse help or to accept, to offer help or to decline it; the right of son to court and daughter to be courted; the right of the hungry to be fed; the rights of the pregnant and the sick to transcend all other rights.
>
>==And the families learned, although no one told them, what rights are monstrous and must be destroyed: the right to intrude upon privacy, the right to be noisy while the camp slept, the right of seduction or rape, the right of adultery and theft and murder.==
>
>==These rights were crushed, because the little worlds could not exist for even a night with such rights alive.  And as the worlds moved westward, rules became laws, although no one told the families.==
>
	It is unlawful to foul near the camp; it is unlawful in any way to foul the drinking water; it is unlawful to eat good rich food near one who is hungry, unless he is asked to share. And with the laws, the punishments—and there were only two—a quick and murderous fight or ostracism; and ostracism was the worst. For if one broke the laws his name and face went with him, and he had no place in any world, no matter where created.
> 
> In the worlds, social conduct became fixed and rigid, so that a man must say “Good morning” when asked for it, so that a man might have a willing girl if he stayed with her, if he fathered her children and protected them. But a man might not have one girl one night and another the next, for this would endanger the worlds.
> 
   The families moved westward, and the technique of building the worlds improved so that the people could be safe in their worlds; and the form was so fixed that a family acting in the rules knew it was safe in the rules.  ==There grew up government in the worlds, with leaders, with elders.==
> And a kind of insurance developed in these nights. A man with food fed a hungry man, and thus insured himself against hunger.

## Stirs of Rebellion

> Is a tractor bad? Is the power that turns the long furrows wrong? If this tractor were ours it would be good—not mine, but ours. If our tractor turned the long furrows of our land, it would be good. Not my land, but ours.
> 
  We could love that tractor then as we have loved this land when it was ours. But this tractor does two things—it turns the land and turns us off the land. There is little difference between this tractor and a tank. The people are driven, intimidated, hurt by both.  We must think about this.
>
> One man, one family driven from the land; this rusty car creaking along the highway to the west.  I lost my land, a single tractor took my land.  I am alone and I am bewildered. 
>   
> And in the night one family camps in a ditch and another family pulls in and the tents come out. The two men squat on their hams and the women and children listen. ==Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution.  Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other.==  Here is the anlage of the thing you fear.  This is the zygote.
> 
> For here “I lost my land” is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate—“We lost _our_ land. ” The danger is here, for two men are not as lonely and perplexed as one. And from this first “we” there grows a still more dangerous thing: “I have a little food” plus “I have none.” If from this problem the sum is “We have a little food,” the thing is on its way, the movement has direction.
> 
> Only a little multiplication now, and this land, this tractor are ours. The two men squatting in a ditch, the little fire, the side-meat stewing in a single pot, the silent, stone-eyed women; behind, the children listening with their souls to words their minds do not understand.
> 
> The night draws down. The baby has a cold. Here, take this blanket. It’s wool. It was my mother’s blanket—take it for the baby. ==This is the thing to bomb.  This is the beginning—from “I” to “we.”== If you who own the things people must have could understand this, you might preserve yourself.
> 
> If you could separate causes from results, if you could know that Paine, Marx, Jefferson, Lenin, were results, not causes, you might survive. But that you cannot know.  ==For the quality of owning freezes you forever into “I,” and cuts you off forever from the “we.”==  The Western States are nervous under the beginning change
> 
> Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action. A half-million people moving over the country; a million more restive, ready to move; ten million more feeling the first nervousness.  And tractors turning the multiple furrows in the vacant land.


## Deceit + Greed
>A great owner bought a cannery.
  And when the peaches and the pears were ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it.
  And as cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned goods up and took his profit.
  And the little farmers who owned no canneries lost their farms, and they were taken by the great owners, the banks, and the companies who also owned the canneries.
  As time went on, there were fewer farms.

>This little orchard will be a part of a great holding next year, for the debt will have choked the owner.
  This vineyard will belong to the bank.
>Only the great owners can survive, for they own the canneries too.

> And four pears peeled and cut in half, cooked and canned, still cost fifteen cents.
> And the canned pears do not spoil.
 > They will last for years.


## The Grapes of Wrath

> Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce.
> Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten.
> And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow.
> ==The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all.==
> Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground.
> The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be.
> ==How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit.==
> A million people hungry, needing the fruit—and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains.
> And the smell of rot fills the country.
> Burn coffee for fuel in the ships.
> Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire.
> Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out.
> Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.
> ====There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation.
> There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize.
> There is a failure here that topples all our success.====
> The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit.
> And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange.
> And coroners must fill in the certificates—died of malnutrition—because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.
> The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed.
> 
> ==And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.

> ==In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.==

## Cops and self-governance

>Cops?” he asked.
   The watchman laughed.
  “No cops.
  We got our own cops.
  Folks here elect their own cops.

> “You mean to say they ain’t no cops?”  
> “No, sir. No cop can come in here without a warrant."
>  “Well, s’pose a fella is jus’ mean, or drunk an’ quarrelsome. What then?”  
>  
>  The watchman stabbed the blotter with a pencil. “Well, the first time the Central Committee warns him.  And the second time they really warn him. The third time they kick him out of the camp."

>  Fella says they ain’t no cops.
>  “Folks is their own cops.”  Casy looked up excitedly.
>  “An’ was they any trouble? Fightin’, stealin’, drinkin’?”  “No,” said Tom.
>   “Well, if a fella went bad—what then? What’d they do?”  “Put ’im outa the camp.” 
>   “But they wasn’ many?” 
>   “Hell, no,” said Tom. “We was there a month, an’ on’y one.” 
>   Casy’s eyes shone with excitement. He turned to the other men.
>  “Ya see?” he cried. “I tol’ you.  Cops cause more trouble than they stop."

## Horses vs men
>If a fella owns a team a horses, he don’t raise no hell if he got to feed ’em when they ain’t workin’.
  But if a fella got men workin’ for him, he jus’ don’t give a damn.
  Horses is a hell of a lot more worth than men.

...

>And sometimes they talked very quietly.
  No work till spring.
  No work.
  And if no work—no money, no food.
  Fella had a team of horses, had to use ’em to plow an’ cultivate an’ mow, wouldn’ think a turnin’ ’em out to starve when they wasn’t workin’.
  Them’s horses—we’re men.

## Takeaway

People want to work, and are vilified as moochers and Okies for being lazy. Steinbeck is careful to portray everyone as wanting to work, but being unable to find it.

It's hard reading this in 2023 without drawing parallels to AI art. This book boils down to three messages  
  
1. Greed is bad  
2. Corporations are worse than any of the people that comprise them  
2b. Corporations act in ways that none of those people desire, and yet.  
3. The only tool workers have to fight 1 and 2 is to form a union. Suspicions cast aside, it's every one together.  
  
Steinbeck's rage and righteous fury shine through his prose. I think I've written more quotes from this book than any other.
