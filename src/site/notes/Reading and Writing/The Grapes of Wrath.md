# The Grapes of Wrath

## Quotes

> “I built it with my hands. Straightened old nails to put the sheathing
> on. Rafters are wired to the stringers with baling wire. It’s mine. I
> built it. You bump it down—I’ll be in the window with a rifle. You even
> come too close and I’ll pot you like a rabbit.”
> 
> “It’s not me. There’s nothing I can do. I’ll lose my job if I don’t do
> it. And look—suppose you kill me? They’ll just hang you, but long
> before you’re hung there’ll be another guy on the tractor, and he’ll
> bump the house down. You’re not killing the right guy.”
> 
> “That’s so,” the tenant said. “Who gave you orders? I’ll go after him.
> He’s the one to kill.”
> 
> “You’re wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told him,
> ‘Clear those people out or it’s your job.’”
> 
> “Well, there’s a president of the bank. There’s a board of directors.
> I’ll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.”
> 
> The driver said, “Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the
> East. The orders were, ‘Make the land show profit or we’ll close you
> up.’”
> 
> “But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don’t aim to starve to
> death before I kill the man that’s starving me.”
> 
> “I don’t know. Maybe there’s nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn’t men
> at all. Maybe, like you said, the property’s doing it. Anyway I told you
> my orders.”
> 
> “I got to figure,” the tenant said. “We all got to figure. There’s some
> way to stop this. It’s not like lightning or earthquakes. We’ve got a
> bad thing made by men, and by God that’s something we can change.” 

*There is no one to blame. It's a mindless machine. A machine made by people.*

> Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold.
> 
> ==And all of them were caught in something larger than themselves. Some of them hated the mathematics that drove them, and some were afraid, and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling.==
> 
> If a bank or a finance company owned the land, the owner man said, The Bank — or the Company — needs — wants — insists — must have — as though the Bank or the Company were a monster, with thought and feeling, which had ensnared them. 
> 
> These last would take no responsibility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves, while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time.
> 
> Some of the owner men were a little proud to be slaves to such cold and powerful masters. The owner men sat in the cars and explained. You know the land is poor. You’ve scrabbled at it long enough, God knows.

*The bank can't be reasoned with*

> But — you see, a bank or a company can’t do that, because those creatures don’t breathe air, don’t eat side-meat. They breathe profits; they eat the interest on money. If they don’t get it, they die the way you die without air, without side-meat: It is a sad thing, but it is so. It is
> just so.
> 
> We can’t depend on it. The bank — the monster has to have profits all the
> time. It can’t wait. It’ll die. No, taxes go on. ==When the monster stops
> growing, it dies.== It can’t stay one size.

*The bank is made by men who hate it*

> We know that—all that. It’s not us, it’s the bank. A bank isn’t like a
> man. Or an owner with fifty thousand acres, he isn’t like a man either.
> That’s the monster.
> 
> Sure, cried the tenant men, but it’s our land. We measured it and broke
> it up. We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if
> it’s no good, it’s still ours. That’s what makes it ours—being born on
> it, working it, dying on it. That makes ownership, not a paper with
> numbers on it.
> 
> We’re sorry. It’s not us. It’s the monster. The bank isn’t like a man.
> 
> Yes, but the bank is only made of men.
> 
> No, you’re wrong there—quite wrong there. The bank is something else
> than men. ==It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It’s the monster. Men made it, but they can’t control it.==

### AI Art
> He loved the land no more than the bank loved the land. He could admire the tractor — its machined surfaces, its surge of power, the roar of its detonating cylinders; but it was not his tractor.
> 
> Behind the tractor rolled the shining disks, cutting the earth with blades— not plowing but surgery, pushing the cut earth to the right where the second row of disks cut it and pushed it to the left; slicing blades shining, polished by the cut earth. 
> 
> And pulled behind the disks, the harrows combing with iron teeth so that the little clods broke up and the earth lay smooth. Behind the harrows, the long seeders — twelve curved iron penes erected in the foundry, orgasms set by gears, raping methodically, raping without passion. 
> 
> The driver sat in his iron seat and he was proud of the straight lines he did not will, proud of the tractor he did not own or love, proud of the power he could not control. And when that crop grew, and was harvested, no man had crumbled a hot clod in his fingers and let the earth sift past his fingertips. No man had touched the seed, or lusted for the growth. 
> 
> Men ate what they had not raised, had no connection with the bread. The land bore under iron, and under iron gradually died; for it was not loved or hated, it had no prayers or curses.
