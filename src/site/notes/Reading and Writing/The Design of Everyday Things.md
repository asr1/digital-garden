* If you struggle to use a tool, consider that the tool is poorly designed
* Signs are a failure of design 
	* If you have to tell the user how a door works, you've failed.
* Affordance vs signifier
	* An Affordance is something an app (or tool) can do 
		* You can shuffle a card, turn it, lift it, discard it, or flip it. These are affordances
		* You can turn a knob, or pull it.
	* A signifier is a sign that reflects an affordance
		* A card indicates (maybe with a shadow) that it can be swiped or elevated or flipped.
	* Some people use affordance to mean signifier "can we add an affordance to make it clear that the user can do XYZ" aaagh!
	* Affordances are great for the physical world because a lever implies sliding, a knob turning, and so on. On UI it's harder to evoke those affordances, so we need to rely on signifiers.
