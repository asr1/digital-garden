I love to read. I typically read between 30 and 70 books a year, depending on whether you count comics.

Some of my favorite books include:
* Idlewild by Nick Sagan
* Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
* Eating the Dinosaur by Chuck Klosterman
* [[Reading and Writing/Books/Name of the Wind\|Name of the Wind]] by Patrick Rothfuss
