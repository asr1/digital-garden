A bullshit job is a concept created by David Graebner, who later wrote a book about it. 

It's a job that is unnecessary, the worker simply pretends to have a purpose. 

According to polls, around 40% of UK workers consider their jobs to fit this description.

I think there's a difference between "dig a hole and then fill it in" and "sit at a desk for 8 hours, tweaking UI to make this web page marginally more attractive". There's also a related concept (as illustrated by Office Space) of filling a seat and "working" for a short period of time.

Graebner argues that previously meaningful work can become a bullshit job though administrative work and managerialism, which he argues is especially prevalent in academia.
