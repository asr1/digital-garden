Board game deisgn math

Baseline value

Each worker gives one action, so you find the most atomic level
  This is your baseline derive value formulas from this
    (x toughness y cost)
    then you add special abiliities in (in most cases this special ability gives you Z additional power) so we ramp up the cost by Q as a result
    Use a spreadsheet to see your model of a card's value or "equivalent actions" (this card is worth 4 actions)
    can check with playtesting too to validate the predictions
    so the balance is in place by playtesting but the PT question is "is this a fun experience"
    
figuring out baseline: 
look at most granular unit you can break down into
  (one worker = one action, which gives 2 resources)
	Compare everything else against thisf
	Currency could be a baseline, or things you can do with one action
	
example: 
one worker gives you 2 resources.
Special ability that lets you build a building for 1 less resource
  You know that that's 1/2 an action of benefit
	If the game is 12 rounds, that's worth 6 actions (if you build a building every round)
	  If you only build 7 buildings in an average game, it's worth 3.5 actions
