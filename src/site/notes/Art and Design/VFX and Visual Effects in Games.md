# VFX and Visual Effects in Games

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L2JvngkkWw&t=4s)

## Principles

==Gameplay is king!==

* Shape
* Contrast
* Color
* Timing

### Gameplay is King

- Work with your designers, be friends with them.
	- They can talk about "I deal 5 damage" can turn into an epic spell
	- Clarity of purpose!

### Shapes
 * Sharp pointy things are inherently dangerous
 * Can indicate AOE with different shapes
	 * e.g. leading AOE of rain of arrows
	 * Can be cracks or slashes over an area
	
### Contrast and Focal Point 

Players need to know what to focus on
	Is there a summon happening, is there damage coming, does someone need healing, etc.

Shapes are helpful, but **value variation** is a quick way to showcase information.

Can also use a hierarchy.

If every ability was equally bright or shiny, it would be hard to tell what's important.

"If everything's important, nothing is".

==What can be ignored, what do I focus?


It's not one ability, it's everything all at once, so you need value balance.

High whites, low darks = high contrast, stands out.

Can transfer focus with a small thing and then hand off to another (e.g. A summons B at a distance)

Communicate clearly: what part of this needs to be dodged?

==Look at effects in grayscale, super helpful to see contrast. ==
Do this before adding color.

### Color and Identity

HUGE topic
- Color theory
- Hues, saturation, values
- VFX on top of it
	- Materials
	- Duration
	- Speed
	- lifetime

Often limited palettes.

Vary hues and colors:

![hue and saturation variation.png](/img/user/img/img_misc/hue%20and%20saturation%20variation.png)
This uses saturation contrast (purple) and hue contrast (yellow) to show focal points.

**Consider Context**
* People only have split second to do something
* Real world connections
* Take water turn it green: acid. Red: blood. Gray: oil
	* Make sure that red healing potion is telegraphed so it doesn't come off as danger


#### What does color mean?
	What does yellow mean?
	Yellow + pink = holy
	Yellow + saturated red = threatening

So mixing colors gives different personality

Some identity from hue variation: light and air ( first two) for example, but value is the same

So we add color depth:

pairing colors for more identity.

Water and ice common, but water has saturated purples, ice has desaturated cyans. (Fourth from top, third from bottom)

So we get schools of magic that have palates and you can identify at a glance with infinite palates.

Can also add team colors, or areas, or mood with subtle variations

36:43 is a bit about color variety and hue saturation and I'm not following any of it.

### Timing and Threat Level

More a feeling or vibe than a science.
	Hard to put into words

#### 12 Principles of Animation
We're focusing on the most relevant 4.

* Squash + Stretch
	* Blue squash makes it FEEL faster, easier to see.
	* No squash makes the frame rate feel slower
* Anticipation
	* Want to warn the player a moment before an explosion happens
* Slow In & Slow Out
	* A burst at the beginning and a long slow fade out is powerful
	* If you can't do anticipation, a fade out still adds satisfaction
* Secondary Action
	* Like a trail

**Intensity over time**

How much is it demanding your attention over time?
