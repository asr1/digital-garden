# Layout

## Typography

Per [Clayton Notestine](https://twitter.com/ClayNotestine/status/1656690720114200577?t=68qKRVApIlw4VG2BA0srtQ&s=19): Typography is the secret to good layout.

If the typefaces betray the idea, don't pair well, hamper reading, or sit disproportionately, your layout is dead.

If you're new, start with the body text. Try lots of versions. Iterate. Then (and only then) build a grid to fit.

See also [wordmark](https://wordmark.it/), which helps you choose fonts for creative projects

### Kerning

Turn a word upside down to better notice shapes and the spaces between them, not letters.
