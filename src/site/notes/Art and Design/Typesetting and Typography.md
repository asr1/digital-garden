# Typesetting

Optical Margin Alignment puts punctuation outside the text frame which makes a strong even line of text.

Turn off hyphenation and switch to single-line composer. This lets you hyphenate yourself, instead of built-in.

The 2nd line of a paragraph should be longer than the first.

Never end a line on the first word after punctuation. Each line should contain a whole number amount of thoughts. One is good, two is good, one and a half is bad.

Do not end a line on a short conjugation. 

Do not end a paragraph on a single-word line. (see also widows and orphans in [[Reading and Writing/Books/The Non-Designers Book of Design\|The Non-Designers Book of Design]]). 

You can apply tracking to an entire line, sparingly. Negative tracking is less obvious than positive tracking. Never go below -25.

Hyphenate only if you must, but make sure there are at least 4 characters before the hyphen.

Avoid Stacked Headers, where and H2 immediately follows an H1. Each header should be followed by at least one sentence explaining what that section is about.

Follow your heart and listen to your eyes.
