## Perfect is the enemy of good

It's better to finish something than to endlessly re-arrange the punctuation until it's perfect.


## Ideaes are worthless, execution is everything

There's nothing new under the sun. Stop kicking yourself for not having a new idea and put your own spin on something else.


## Finished is better than an idea

Everyone's got a half-finished manuscript under their bed. It's easier to start a project than it is to finish it.

### Don't talk about it until it's done

It's easy to get the same sort of glee and pleasure from talking about a project as you do from actually doing it. ==**Don't.**== This is a trap. Keep quiet, get the thing done, then show it off. 

*counterpoint:* Some people are able to and enjoy [[Building in public\|Building in public]]. They take accountability from having an audience. I am not one of those people. Know yourself, and know yourself well.


## You've got to start somewhere. More than that, you've got to start

The worst idea you've put to page is better than the best idea in your head. You can't edit until you've written. 

Write bad, edit later. 


## Deadlines

A book is only late once, it sucks forever.


## We're all born knowing nothing

There's only one way to get good at building a chess board, and that's by making a lot of bad chess baords.
