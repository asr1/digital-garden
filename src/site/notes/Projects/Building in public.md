Building in public is the idea that you build something and tell people about it all the while. 

Publish regular Patreon updates or twitter posts. 

It builds accountability. 

But you need to be careful not to fall into the trap of [[Projects/Project Beliefs#Don't talk about it until it's done\|talking instead of doing]].
