I wanted to see if it was possible to get a stock computer version of Myst running on a Nintendo 2DS, and the answer is yes! It was surprisingly easy, almost not worth making a note over.

Basically all I had to do was homebrew the DS to run custom software (that's a given for any project of this type), and then load up the SCUMMVM emulator on there. Then I just had to transfer over a stock [gog.com](https://gog.com) version of the game and BAM! Myst runs as if it were a Mac in 1993. Maybe better; I wasn't alive then.
