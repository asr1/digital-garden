It's far more important to be understood than it is to be correct. 

Is a brontosaurus a dinosaur? [It's complicated](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/brontosaurus-reinstating-a-prehistoric-icon.html) But the fact is many people won't know what a sauropod is.

There are times when it's okay to be wrong. There's a difference between *appealing* to the lowest common denominator and  *communicating* to the same.
